# Learning Linear Algebra and Using NumPy

## Introduction
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is fundamental to various fields such as computer science, engineering, physics, and machine learning. NumPy is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into linear algebra and NumPy, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming
- Basic mathematical concepts

## Topics Covered
1. **Vectors and Scalars**
   - Definition and properties
   - Vector operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication)
   - Dot product and cross product

2. **Matrices**
   - Definition and properties
   - Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
   - Transpose of a matrix
   - Inverse of a matrix
   - Determinant of a matrix

3. **Linear Transformations**
   - Definition and examples
   - Matrix representation of linear transformations
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

4. **Systems of Linear Equations**
   - Solving systems of linear equations using matrices

## Using NumPy for Linear Algebra
NumPy provides a wide range of functions to perform linear algebra operations efficiently. Below are some common operations and their corresponding NumPy functions:

### Creating Arrays
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a vector
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Creating a matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
